# Android-COntrolled RObotic ARM (Python)

A basic simulation of a robotic arm controlled via ANdroid (simulated via command input).
In a real-world case, this could use Bluetooth or HTTP to receive real-time commands from a mobile device.

## Features

- Receives commands from Android (mocked)

## Run

'''bash
python main.py
