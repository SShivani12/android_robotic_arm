## Key Features
- Lightweight Flask API for easy deployment
- Real-time control of robotic arm movements
- Integration with Android app for remote commands
- Suitable for automation, robotics learning, and prototyping

## Functionality
- Simulates robotic arm movements: up, down, left, right, grab, release
- Receives commands from an Android app (can be simulated via HTTP or Bluetooth)
